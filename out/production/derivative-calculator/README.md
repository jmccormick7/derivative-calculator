# derivative-calculator
Created a derivative calculator using Object Oriented Programming in Java for CSDS 132
Functions are created using combinations of 8 different classes representing multiple types of functions.
The functions can have many types of functions all nested inside one another for added complexity. 
The derivative() method finds the derivative of any inputted function.
Meanwhile value(input) gives the value of the function at a given x-component.
